# Unpoko ðŸ¤ ðŸŒµ

Unpoko is a project that aims to make plants connected by collecting their various data (CO2, humidity, temperature) and triggering actions according to the rates (opening a window, triggering a loudspeaker, turning on an LED).

Produced as part of the "Communicating Objects" course at ENSSAT

Made by [Antoine Maurais](https://github.com/antoineMaurais), [Emilie Daniel](https://github.com/edanielENSSAT), [Ludivine Biot](https://github.com/Wudline), [Mathis Boultoureau](https://github.com/mboultoureau/) et [Sylvain Mestre](https://github.com/Shult)

All the individual sensor and actuator codes are present in `research`. The main source code is in `src`.   

## Features

- Displays soil moisture content on a 4-digit display
- Bluetooth communication between master, slave and telephone
- View soil moisture levels on your phone
- Launch disco mode send `disco` on the phone

## Possible developments

- Add the various sensors and actuators
- Create scenarios that trigger actions based on different values
- Mobile application for configuring thresholds and graphically displaying data
